        <p class="text">Welcome to the rural community of Elk Grove, California.  Here you will find a mix of 
            country living and the urban sprawl we have come to expect from the suburbs.  There is a good mix of 
            fields, farm life, city dwelling structures, large businesses and plenty of "mom and pop" shops.
        </p>
        <img src="images/placeholder.jpg" data-src="images/cows1.jpg" alt="Cows">
        <p class="text">Nestled among the suburban housing communities, local shopping and eateries, don't be
            surprised to see all manner of country life.  From cows to chickens, goats and sheep, occasional llamas,
            pigs, plenty of squirrels, birds, possums and skunks make Elk Grove their home.  If you listen carefully,
            you might hear the occasional howl of a lonely coyote.
        </p>
        <img src="images/placeholder.jpg" data-src="images/elkmural.jpg" alt="Elk mural">
        <p class="text">Elk Grove takes it name from the Tule Elk that once inhabited many regions of California.  Today, 
            you can see Tule Elk at Point Reyes as they have an elk preserve there.  We are proud of the species
            that once called this land home and we remember them in our name and the many represenations we have of
            elk around the city.
        </p>
        <img src="images/placeholder.jpg" data-src="images/rhoadsschool.jpg" alt="Rhodes School">
        <p class="text">The Rhoads School was founded in the 1850's by pioneers who were working and residing at Sutter's Fort.
            The school's name is rumored to be in honor of John P. Rhoads whose wagon train travelled  part of the way west with
            the famed Donner Party.  The Rhoads wagon train arrived in the Sacramento Valley and were safe from the 
            surprise winter storms which ravished the Donner party.  John P. Rhoads made three rescue missions to the Donner
            party.  This is a wonderful historical piece right in the heart of Elk Grove, and school children today are able 
            to experience life in a one-room schoolhouse year round.
        </p>
        <img src="images/placeholder.jpg" data-src="images/parktrees.jpg" alt="Park with trees">
        <p class="text">Elk Grove thrives on community, just as these mighty trees thrive on a strong, interconnected
            root system.  By bringing together families in work and play, we continue to develop a sense of unity within
            our community.  
        </p>
        <img src="images/placeholder.jpg" data-src="images/sportspark.jpg" alt="Sports Park">
        <p class="text">In addition to the many natural resources, we pride ourselves on the many extracurricular
            activities we offer through our community services district.  We have Olympic-sized competition pools, various
            indoor and outdoor sports leagues, and a multitude of classes ranging from adult education, to preschool programs,
            we strive to care for each and every citizen in our community.
