            <h2>Site Purpose:</h2>
            <div class="box"><p>The Elk Grove Commerce Chamber site seeks to connect businesses with the community we serve.
                We know that every community thrives on those who live, work and play there, so we are dedicated
                to connecting the businesses within the community with those who also call Elk Grove home.  This site
                will provide a brief historical narrative of Elk Grove through the years, from a small farming community
                to a booming economic center.  We want to help the community engage with one another, so we are
                hosting many community events.  This site will also provide a directory of the businesses which are run
                here.  There is so much to offer our community, from colleges to cafes, schools, churches, shopping, 
                athletic events and more.</p></div>
