    <h3>Persona 1:</h3>
    <p class="paragraph">Kate Green is a 42-year-old white, single mom.  She owns a small boutique in an older part of Elk Grove
        that caters to baby and toddler fashion.  She is interested in the Elk Grove Commerce Chamber Website
        as she seeks to get more business in her store.  Because of the location, she doesn't get the foot traffic
        she would like.  Most of her business comes from word-of-mouth.  She would like to get her name and
        business out there by connecting with other businesses and members of her community.  She is looking
        for a different space to rest which will allow her to be in a more desirable location, and help her
        expand her business.  She would also like to find others in her community who have similar interests 
        as her and a place where she can feel comfortable raising her family.

    <h3>Persona 2:</h3>
    <p class="paragraph">Anil and Kaeya Patel are a young married couple whose families immigrated from India.  They have
        recently settled in Elk Grove with Kaeya's parents.  Anil and Kaeya want to open a resturant which
        featuring flavors from back home.  With a demographic that supports this type of restaurant venture,
        they are interested in looking for spaces that will allow them to run the restaurant, but they would
        also like to have a banquet space that can be rented out.  Families are essential in their culture, and gathering
        in families would make a great business venture if they offer a place for families to rent out.  They 
        would like to connect with other Indian business owners in the area as well as teach others in their
        community about their culture.
